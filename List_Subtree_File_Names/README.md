# List the Files and Subdirectories of a Subtree.

This project is a WINDOWS FORMS APPLICATION and was written for .NET Framework, Version=v4.6 .

The zip file "ListDirectoryNFileNames.zip" has the (3) source files of a C# application that can generate a list of all files and subdirectories present in a desired path or even along all its subtree.

The objective of this project is to provide an easy way to help in the documentation of the contents of a directory/subtree.

Once the Base Directory (of this path) is defined by the user, the list of files and subdirectories are generated inside a TextBox control, and can be "copy and paste'd" to any text editor.

In the "Help" menu you will find instructions on how to use it.
